# Modern-Cplusplus-Course-2020
Just revised some C++ for robotics from https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/cpp-course-2020/

To start off we need to setup our environment, for this I followed: https://github.com/nachovizzo/must-have-tools/wiki

Except that I have used the following command to install clang as I am using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

sudo apt-get install -y clang-3.5 libclang1-3.5 libobjc-4.8-dev
